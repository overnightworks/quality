# quality

`quality` is the one door for fleet quality checks.

    quality hygiene [PATH]
    quality sonar preflight [PATH]
    quality sonar findings

`hygiene` reads git's view of the repository at `PATH` (default `.`) and applies two rules:

- `env-file`: no tracked `.env`, `.env.*` or `*.env` file (names ending in `.example` are templates and pass).
- `compose-port`: every published port in a tracked `compose*.y{a,}ml` or `docker-compose*.y{a,}ml` binds `127.0.0.1`.

With `--engines DIR` the `secret` rule also scans the whole history reachable from `HEAD` with gitleaks (a key removed later is still found; other branches the checkout fetched are not scanned), always with quality's own config
(`src/quality/gitleaks.toml`): the repository's `.gitleaks.toml`, `.gitleaksignore` and `gitleaks:allow`
comments have no effect. A known false positive is allowed by the value, not the place: the repository's
`quality/config.toml` names the gitleaks rule, the file and the SHA-256 of the finding's secret (UTF-8, lowercase hex)
with a reason:

    [secrets]
    allow = [{ rule = "aws-access-token", file = "tests/fixture.py", secret_sha256 = "<64 hex>", reason = "fixture value" }]

One entry allows that value in that file at any line and in every commit that holds it. Another value in the same
place is red, and the same value in another file is red. A red finding prints its hash
(`secret src/a.py:3 - gitleaks rule aws-access-token matched at 76ec522b (sha256 <64 hex>, value not shown).`), so
the entry is copied from the output. An entry without a reason, a hash that is not 64 lowercase hex, a duplicate
`(rule, file, secret_sha256)` and the old `fingerprint` form are exit `2`.

A missing `quality/config.toml` means no allowances: the scan still runs and its findings are red. Only a file that
exists and cannot be read or parsed is exit `2`.

Secret handling: quality runs gitleaks without `--redact` so the report carries each `Secret` to be hashed. gitleaks
writes that report to a `tempfile` scratch directory (mode 0700); quality reads it, keeps only the hash, and deletes
the directory on every exit path (success, gitleaks failure, parse error). The value reaches no stdout,
stderr, log, exception text or retained file; gitleaks runs without `-v`. While the scan runs, the value exists in
that report file and in quality's process memory. The boundary is the deletion and the absence of any other sink,
not memory-only handling. The hash is safe to print: it appears only where the history already shows the content,
and a real secret must be rotated anyway.

The scan runs git without any attributes (not the repository's `.gitattributes`, not `info/attributes`, not the
system or global file), so a `-diff` or `binary` line cannot hide a key. That needs git 2.41 or newer; an older git
is exit `2`. The system file is excluded by `GIT_ATTR_NOSYSTEM`, git's documented switch; that is pinned as an
environment contract, not by a root-only real-file test.

Every allowed finding is printed with the entry's reason (`secret: 1 allowed (src/x.py:139)`, then
  `allowed src/x.py:139 - gitleaks rule generic-api-key allowed: enum value, not a key`).

Each finding names the rule, the file, a reason and a fix. Exit `0` is clean, `1` means findings,
`2` means the repository could not be judged (never clean).

## `quality sonar findings`

`gate.yml` runs SonarCloud's scanner in its `sonar` job and judges it through `verdict`; callers use `gate.yml`, never
an action, because quality publishes none. A caller passes the Actions secret by name
(`secrets: SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}`), has automatic analysis off in SonarCloud, and commits a root
`sonar-project.properties`. A missing or empty token is red (`sonar: cannot judge - SONAR_TOKEN is empty`), never
skipped; Dependabot runs resolve the Dependabot secret of the same name.

`quality sonar preflight [PATH]` runs before the scan and refuses (exit `2`, naming the key) any property outside an
allowlist (`sonar.organization`, `sonar.projectKey`, `sonar.projectName`, `sonar.sources`, `sonar.tests`, the
inclusion/exclusion keys, `sonar.sourceEncoding`, `sonar.python.version` and the two coverage report path keys), any
value containing a `${...}` substitution after decoding (the scanner would expand `${env.SONAR_TOKEN}`), a
`sonar.organization` or `sonar.projectKey` other than `<owner>` and `<owner>_<repo>`, a tracked `.scannerwork/`, and
an empty token. The file is read with the `java.util.Properties` grammar (`=`, `:` or whitespace separators, `\`
continuation, `\uXXXX` and `\` escapes).

The scanner's transport, verified at sonar-scanner-java-library 4.1.1.1633 (the library of sonar-scanner-cli
8.1.0.6389, which `gate.yml` pins through `scannerVersion`):

- The bootstrap's authenticated requests reach only `sonarcloud.io` and `api.sonarcloud.io`. This holds only with the
  pinned `-Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io` argument and a properties file that passed preflight.
- Residual limit: a redirect issued by SonarCloud itself carries the token to the host it names.
- The engine is downloaded from SonarCloud and is not pinned by the CLI pin. SonarSource's server-side code is an
  accepted trust boundary: the token's only purpose is to authenticate to SonarCloud.
- Re-verify all of this on any bump of the scan action or `scannerVersion`.

`quality sonar findings` is the SonarCloud zero-findings rule. It reads the scanner's `.scannerwork/report-task.txt` relative to the working directory (no other path can be given); a missing or unreadable file is exit 2.

The project is the caller's repository: `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` gives the key `<owner>_<repo>` and the organization
`<owner>`. The task file must name that `projectKey`, `organization=<owner>` and `serverUrl=https://sonarcloud.io`; the URLs inside it are never
requested. The command polls `api/ce/task` until its own analysis is `SUCCESS` and bound to this component, organization
and pull request (or branch), then reads the open findings with `SONAR_TOKEN` (header only, never printed). On
`pull_request` any open finding is exit `1`; on any other event the count is reported and the exit is `0` until the
baseline exists. Anything unreadable is exit `2`.
